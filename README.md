# LandResourceMgmtGame
This is an ASCII turn-based resource management game where you are king and you try to keep all your villagers happy while simultaneously earning as many coins as you can.

During each hour, you can either recruit a villager, build a farm, build/upgrade a wall, or wait. Assigning villagers to farms will earn funds each hour. At night, there is a chance for an enemy to spawn and attack your wall. If an enemy attacks while you have no walls, you lose!
